## üìñ Overview / Introduction
The Olympic Games (a major international sporting event featuring summer and winter sports competitions) is an event held every four years, involving thousands of athletes from around the world, who represent their countries in various sporting competitions.
This Project seeks to explore the vast amount of events data (which has been collected decades over), uncovering insights amongst the competing countries, across the various games, and analyzing them to profer descriptive analogies as well as providing automated processes to fish out important statistics.

## üìÇ Dataset
The Dataset used for this project is [Olympics Event Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/semaaabumousa/athlete-eventscsv) available on Kaggle

SELECT *
FROM (
		SELECT [NOC], TotalMedal,
			DENSE_RANK() OVER (ORDER BY TotalMedal desc) Position
		FROM TopNoc_total
	) sub
WHERE Position IN (@pos1, @pos2, @pos3)
;

-- Testing the function
SELECT *
FROM top_nations_overall(1,2,3) AS nat
INNER JOIN noc_regions AS ncr
	ON nat.NOC = ncr.NOC
ORDER BY Position ;

------------------------------------------------------------------
-- If we want to know the NOC with the highest individual medals 
CREATE FUNCTION top_nations

RETURNS TABLE
AS
RETURN
WITH TopNoc AS 
	(	SELECT [NOC], Medal,
		Count(Medal) AS MedalCount

		GROUP BY [NOC], Medal
	)
SELECT *
FROM (
		SELECT [NOC], Medal, MedalCount,
			DENSE_RANK() OVER (ORDER BY MedalCount desc) MedalRanks
		FROM TopNoc
	) sub
WHERE MedalRanks IN (@rank1, @rank2, @rank3)
;

-- Testing Function
-- Selecting Top 3 nations with the highest gold medals, also indicating their region and notes (if present)
SELECT nat.*,
	ncr.region AS Region,
	ncr.notes AS Notes
